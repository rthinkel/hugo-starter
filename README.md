# Hugo Starter Site
## Theme: Tailwind Starter

This project is meant to be cloned for future websites. The idea is to have a centralized code-base for the content to sit on top of.

Each subsequent clone is meant to have individual design assets associated with its respective project, all relying on a shared set of pre-built functionality and reference names.
